## :link: Project description

**Final grade:** 10/10

This is a project developed as part of the 2rd evaluation of the Algorithms and Programming II discipline, taught by Professor Alan Rafael Ferreira dos Santos at the Federal University of PiauÃ­ - Campus Senador HelvÃ­dio Nunes de Barros, in the Bachelor's degree in Information Systems.

This C program implements the classic snake game, where the player controls a snake in a limited environment and must collect fruit to increase his score, avoiding colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. The game offers a menu with options to play, access a tutorial, adjust difficulty levels and view a points ranking. During gameplay, the snake moves in four directions (up, down, left and right) in response to keyboard inputs. The snake's speed increases as the player collects more fruits. The game ends when the snake collides with the edges of the board or its own body, displaying the final score and offering the option to play again or exit the game. The code uses functions to manage the snake's movement, random fruit generation, collision detection and interaction with the player through the console.
